<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Hello, and welcome to my about me page!
</p>

<p>
My name is Jake, and I am a data science student at SMU. I have always been passionate about data, statistics, and finding patterns in complex datasets, which led me to 
pursue a career in data analysis. With over 5 years of experience working as a data analyst at PepsiCo and Toyota, I have gained extensive knowledge and expertise in 
data processing, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making.
</p>

<p>
During my time at PepsiCo, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that involved analyzing sales data, conducting market research, and developing predictive
models to forecast future trends. I was also responsible for creating dashboards and reports to provide valuable insights to different departments within the company. 
This experience taught me the importance of using data to drive business decisions and the value of effective communication to ensure that insights are well understood.
</p>

<p>
After working at PepsiCo, I joined Toyota, where I continued to refine my skills as a data analyst. My responsibilities included analyzing supply chain data, 
developing statistical models to optimize inventory levels, and identifying areas for process improvement. I was also involved in creating machine learning models 
to predict production defects, which helped to reduce waste and improve overall efficiency.
</p>

<p>
As a data science student at SMU, I am constantly learning new techniques and tools to better analyze and interpret data. I am particularly interested in machine 
learning and its applications in different domains, such as healthcare and finance. I am also passionate about data ethics and believe that data scientists have a 
responsibility to ensure that the insights they provide are unbiased and ethical.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I enjoy reading books on data science and machine learning, exploring new data visualization tools, and attending meetups to network with other data 
enthusiasts. I also enjoy volunteering at non-profit organizations that use data to drive social impact.
